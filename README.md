# Notes
This is the solution I came up with during the limited time given.

I sorted the libraries by an efficiency ratio books per day divided by sign up time. This is obviously not the optimal way to solve this problem. This can be seen in the output files where some libraries that were signed up early would only send in one or two books.

I also used a hash table to keep track of the books that were already sent in.

My solution placed in the 5331 out of 10724 teams.

I participated in this competition by myself.
